            <p>With Introverted Intuition dominating their personality, INTJs focus their energy on observing the world, and generating
            ideas and possibilities. Their mind constantly gathers information and makes associations about it. They are tremendously
            insightful and usually are very quick to understand new ideas. However, their primary interest is not understanding a concept,
            but rather applying that concept in a useful way. Unlike the INTP, they do not follow an idea as far as they possibly can,
            seeking only to understand it fully. INTJs are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for closure and organization
            usually requires that they take some action.</p>

                <h3 id="strengths">Strengths &amp; Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4><em>Strengths</em></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick, Imaginative and Strategic Mind – INTJs pride themselves on their minds, taking every opportunity to improve their
                    knowledge, and this shows in the strength and flexibility of their strategic thinking.</li>
                    <li>High Self-Confidence – INTJs trust their rationalism above all else, so when they come to a conclusion, they have no reason
                    to doubt their findings. This creates an honest, direct style of communication that isn’t held back by perceived social roles
                    or expectations.</li>
                    <li>Independent and Decisive – This creativity, logic and confidence come together to form individuals who stand on their own
                    and take responsibility for their own actions.</li>
                    <li>Jacks-of-all-Trades – INTJs’ open-mindedness, determination, independence, confidence and strategic abilities create individuals
                    who are capable of doing anything they set their minds to.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><em>Weaknesses</em></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrogant – INTJs are perfectly capable of carrying their confidence too far, falsely believing that they’ve resolved all
                    the pertinent issues of a matter and closing themselves off to the opinions of those they believe to be intellectually inferior.</li>
                    <li>Judgmental – INTJs tend to have complete confidence in their thought process, because rational arguments are almost by definition
                    correct – at least in theory.</li>
                    <li>Overly analytical – A recurring theme with INTJs is their analytical prowess, but this strength can fall painfully short
                    where logic doesn’t rule – such as with human relationships.</li>
                    <li>Loathe highly structured environments – Blindly following precedents and rules without understanding them is distasteful
                    to INTJs, and they disdain even more authority figures who blindly uphold those laws and rules without understanding their
                    intent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="group"><em>How to Deal With Me In a Group Project</em></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I dislike group work because of some horrible past experiences. Just pull your weight and ask for help when you need to. If you dont seem to care about the project, I might get a little grumpy.</li>
                    <li>I usually keep to myself in order to stay focused, so just let me know if I am needed.</li>
                    <li>I have a horrible habit of saying things in the worst way. If I say something that seems a little blunt or judgemental, I'm sorry ahead of time. </li>
                    <li>I might look like I know what I'm doing, but If i'm wrong just let me know.</li>
                </ul>
